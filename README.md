# Graph2Seq
This repository contains my implementations of [Graph2Seq](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00823.pdf).

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Tensorflow 1.8 +
- Numpy
- Gensim

## Data

See data format in `data` folder which including the data sample files.

### Data Format

This repository can be used in other datasets by two ways:

1. Modify your datasets into the same format of the sample.
2. Modify the data preprocess code in `data_helpers.py`.

Anyway, it should depends on what your data and task are.

## Network Structure

The framework of Graph2Seq:

1.
